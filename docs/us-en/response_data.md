# Response Data

> The response headers and response body, as well as error messages may vary between different Scrapingbypass API
> versions.

The Scrapingbypass API response data is synchronized with the target server response data. If a request fails, the
response status code is set according to the error type.

### Response Headers

The Scrapingbypass API will process the following response headers:

* `content-length` `content-encoding` The response body may be compressed, so these fields may change.
* `date` `connection` `transfer-encoding` `datekeep-alive` `server` `vary` are removed.
* `access-control-allow-origin` `access-control-allow-credentials` `access-control-allow-headers` `access-control-allow-method`
  are set to *.
* `set-cookie` v2 will filter out cloudflare related cookies.

The following are the response header fields of the Scrapingbypass service:

| PARAMETER   | SUPPORTED VERSION |  TYPE  | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|:------------------:|:------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| x-cb-status |       `All`        | string | Response status, returning `ok` means the request is processed successfully, and empty means the request fails. <br /> When returning `ok`, the corresponding points will be deducted. |

### Response Body

If the response header `x-cb-status` is `ok`, the response body will return all the body data directly.

The body data of the Scrapingbypass service response will be compressed according to the `Accept-Encoding` field in the request header. Currently, `gzip`, `deflate`, `br` and other compression methods are supported.

When an error occurs, the body data of the Scrapingbypass service response will be parsed according to the error type, and the response body is in JSON format [error information](/us-en/response_data?id=error-message).

?> The Scrapingbypass SDK will automatically handle response errors and throw exceptions. When using the HTTP API, you need to determine the response status yourself.

### Error message

The error message is a piece of data in JSON format, containing the following fields:

* `id` Request a unique ID, which can be used by administrators to troubleshoot problems.
* `code` [Error code](/us-en/response_data?id=error-code), used to identify the error type.
* `message` Error message, describing the detailed cause of the error.

```json
{
  "id": "xxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx",
  "code": "PARAM_ERROR",
  "message": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
